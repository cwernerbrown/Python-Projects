PYTHON PROJECTS

This is a space where I have added my stand-alone projects using Python programming language.

You'll find a collection of coding projects that have been developed for the purposes of personal learning and experimentation with the specific programming language.

Vowel_letter_count code was part of my project submission for the CISCO: Python Progranning course.
